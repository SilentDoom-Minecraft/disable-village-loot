Disables all loot from chests in villages. This can be added to your current world and will disable newly generated villages.

## How To Install

1. Download zip file.
2. Navigate to the datapacks folder in your minecraft world:
   `%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/worldname/datapacks/`
3. Drag downloaded zip file into this folder (you donâ€™t have to unzip it).
4. The datapack will be active next time you load your world. If not, run the /reload command.
